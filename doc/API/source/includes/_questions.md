# Questions

We implement Watson Conversation System with Retrivement and Rank to get a smooth conversation.

## Send a Question in Lite Version

### HTTP Request

`post /questions/send-lite`

> To get an answer to a question or start a conversation, use this code:

```javascript
fetch("/questions/send-lite", {  
  method: 'post',  
  headers: {  
    "Content-type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
        'question': '',
        'context' : {}
  })
}).then(response=>{return response.json()})
.then(json=> {
  //json contains responses
})
```

The "send-lite" API requires 2 parameter in the request body

Parameter          | Description
------------------ | --------------------------------------
question           | A question should be in the request body
context            | A context is an object generated by server to track a conversation.

<aside class="notice">
For the first post, the context is an empty object. Then, it should be the same with the one from server.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
The response are either with useful information or the request to restate a question.
</aside>
